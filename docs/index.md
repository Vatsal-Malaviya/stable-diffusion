# Diffusion Models Implementation

Advanced implementation of diffusion models using PyTorch Lightning and JAX.

## Project Overview
This project implements diffusion models from scratch, focusing on both U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. The implementation includes modern training techniques, MLOps practices, and optimization strategies.

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch Lightning
- JAX
- MLflow
- Docker
- FastAPI

## Development Roadmap
Currently in progress:
- U-Net architecture implementation
- Basic diffusion process
- Project infrastructure setup

Next in line:
- DiT (Diffusion Transformer) implementation
- LoRA fine-tuning integration
- MLflow experiment tracking
